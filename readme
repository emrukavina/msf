🎬 Movie Site Finder
====================

Movie Site Finder is a web service that redirects you to the first currently available free movie site.

Just visit:
👉 https://emrukavina.com/msf

It will automatically redirect you to a working movie site.

Note: The service is hosted for free, sometimes it can take up to a minute for it to find a site, but when it does, at least u know that that site works. Its kinda; "I check whats online and whats not so u dont have to :)"

🛠️ Building & Running with Docker
=================================
docker build -t movie-site-finder .
docker run -p 8080:8080 movie-site-finder

With environment variable (optional):
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e PORT=8080 movie-site-finder

The app listens on port 8080 by default, but you can override it using the PORT environment variable.

TODO
====
- make it read from a .txt instead of hardcoded links
